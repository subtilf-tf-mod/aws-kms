# Terraform module of  AWS - KMS (Key Management Service) - Just for learn purpose!!! 

All terraform modules from my repositories is only for learn purpose, so it can be broken, incomplete or not working well!

So if you use that code be careful and you will be at your own!!! Good lucky!!!

# What is KMS?
AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) is a managed service that makes it easy for you to create and control customer master keys (CMKs), the encryption keys used to encrypt your data.

AWS KMS is integrated with most other AWS services that encrypt your data. AWS KMS is also integrated with AWS CloudTrail to log use of your CMKs for auditing, regulatory, and compliance needs.

# Motivation
I wrote a lot of codes using terraform modules and for each individual project I had to replicated the modules.

Therefore as terraform accept to work with remote repositories I decided to use github as my source of terraform modules.

# About the project
This project just store the common git files (license and readme.md) and terraform files (main, var and output).
